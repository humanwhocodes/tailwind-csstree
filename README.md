# Tailwind CSSTree

## Description

Tailwind custom syntax in CSSTree format.

## Installation

```shell
npm install @humanwhocodes/tailwind-csstree
```

## Usage

This package exports the following objects:

- `tailwind3` - CSSTree syntax extensions for Tailwind 3 syntax
- `tailwind4` - CSSTree syntax extensions for Tailwind 4 syntax

You can import them like this:

```js
import { tailwind3, tailwind4 } from "tailwind-csstree";
```

### Use with ESLint CSS Plugin

To use this package with the [ESLint CSS plugin](https://github.com/eslint/css), use `languageOptions.customSyntax` to specify the Tailwind version you'd like to use in your `eslint.config.js` file:

```js
// eslint.config.js
import { defineConfig } from "eslint/config";
import css from "@eslint/css";
import { tailwind4 } from "tailwind-csstree";

export default defineConfig([
	{
		files: ["**/*.css"],
		plugins: {
			css,
		},
		language: "css/css",
		languageOptions: {
			customSyntax: tailwind4,
		},
		rules: {
			"css/no-empty-blocks": "error",
		},
	},
]);
```

**Note:** Not all ESLint CSS plugin rules will work with Tailwind syntax. That's something I'm actively working on.

### Use with CSSTree directly

If you're using [CSSTree](https://github.com/eslint/css-tree) directly, you

```js
import { fork } from "@eslint/css-tree";
import { tailwind4 } from "tailwind-csstree";

const { parse, toPlainObject } = fork(tailwind4);

const result = parse("@config 'tailwind.config.js'");
console.log(toPlainObject(result));
```
